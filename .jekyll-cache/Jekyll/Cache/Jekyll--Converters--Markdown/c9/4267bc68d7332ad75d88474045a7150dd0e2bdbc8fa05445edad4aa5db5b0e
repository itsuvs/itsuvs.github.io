I"a<p>At last, my portfolio website is ready. [Thanks for the applause!] 
<br />It took only about 2 years, 5 revisions and a bit of procrastination to finally feel good about it’s asthetics before making it online. Don’t we all suffer from perfectionism? Nonetheless, I absolutely love my current portfolio. I think it complements my personality.</p>
