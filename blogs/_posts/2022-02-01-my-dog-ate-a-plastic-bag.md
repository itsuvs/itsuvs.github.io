title: My Dog Ate A Plastic Bag
category: Self
---

I did it again. After committing on blogging regularly, I skipped so many days. Totally my ignorance. Please pardon me this time. Today, I have something serious to talk about. My dog ate a plastic bag.

<br/>It was early morning today, I was walking my doberman as usual when he encountered a big plastic bag on the ground. Joey, as with any other dogs, has a habit of putting things in his mouth, play a bit and then spit them out but this time he started to chew and swallow (the bag looked like it had some food in it). I tried to take the bag out of his mouth but quite the agression he showed to me. At the end, he swallowed it all.

<br/>
My family and me were extremely worried and the fact that out of 10 cases of animal swallowing plastic bag 6 cases usually turn out to be fatal made us more nervous. Fortunately, after 10 hours Joey pooped the bag out. Such a moment of relief!

<br/>
Today's incident made me realize how our ignorance can play a tragic part in someone else's life. Reminds me of the movie 'Babel'. Even though our world is immeasureably big but somehow our actions have the power to impact someone's life who we have never met before or might never meet in life. Hence, its imperatively important to act responsible.
