        <p>At last, my portfolio website is ready. [Thanks for the applause!] 
<br />It took only about 2 years, 5 revisions and a bit of procrastination to finally feel good about it’s asthetics before making it online. Don’t we all suffer from perfectionism? Nonetheless, I absolutely love my current portfolio. I think it complements my personality.</p>

<p><br />Coming to the point, this is my very first blog here. After all failed attempts at blogging, this time I have decided to keep it simple. No more niche, no more stress. This time I would write whatever suits my mood. That means sometimes it would be about something techy and sometimes it would simply be about life, sometimes it would be about my favorite movie and other times it would be about current affairs.</p>

<p><br />I believe working as a copywriter inspired an urge in me to continue writing as a hobby. After all, the task that sometimes frustrates me so much also helps me calm down. But there are a few things I need to stop if I want to keep writing regularly. Those things would be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Keeping track of time:</span> I tend to get lost in words and sentences; as a result my writing gets messy and time consuming. This has to stop! No more than an hour.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Maintaining a time table:</span> For me, having a time table is quiet crucial to blog regularly. This way I get sufficient time to think on the topic before writing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Ignoring negative vibes:</span> Often times we hamper our potential by giving shit about what others would think. I gotta do less of that. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold">Stop being perfectionist:</span> It's startling to realize how much time and resource we waste just perfecting things. I definitely need to get rid of this lame habit.   
    </li>
</ul>

<p>I guess if I could do things mentioned above, I would become pretty consistent and efficient at writing and I guess then I would really be able to appreciate the joy that comes from blogging. I feel there are few more things to mention but I can’t think of them right now. Guess I will update them later. That’s it for now. Ciao :)</p>
