                I am a self-taught coder, a mediocre hacker and a wannabe artist.

                I used to work in advertising but building cool internet products is my latest gig now and I am totally
                loving it.

                Forever a star-gazing wanderer, a misfit, always questioning, always seeking and constantly feeling
                burdened with a glorious purpose. I am the kind of person who looks for depth even in the shallowest
                places and who loves to root for
                the underdogs no matter what the circumstances be.
