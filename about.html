        <p> 
            I am a self-taught coder, a mediocre hacker and a wannabe artist.
            I used to work in advertising but building cool internet products is my latest gig now and I am totally loving it.

            Forever a star-gazing wanderer, a misfit, always questioning, always seeking and constantly feeling
            burdened with a glorious purpose. I am the kind of person who looks for depth even in the shallowest places and who loves to root for 
            the underdogs no matter what the circumstances be.
