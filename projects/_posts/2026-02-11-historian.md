<br>

**Historian** is a powerful Chrome extension designed to help you regain control over your digital footprint. Unlike the standard browser history which presents a cluttered, linear list, Historian intelligently tracks and organizes your browsing activity by segregating data based on the domain.

<br>

### **Key Features:**

<br>

- **Domain-Based Segregation**: Automatically groups your history by website, allowing you to see exactly how much time you spend on specific platforms.
- **Intuitive Organization**: Easily navigate through your past activity without scrolling through endless pages of disjointed links.
- **Privacy-First**: Keep your history organized locally on your machine.

<br>

### **Future Roadmap:**

<br>

The vision for Historian goes beyond personal organization. The next major update aims to make your curated history **shareable**. Whether you want to share a list of research resources, a collection of interesting articles, or a curated learning path, Historian will allow you to package and share your domain-specific history with others.
